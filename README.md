phylanx-data-wrangling
======================
Some wrangling scripts for OTF2 + tree data from running phylanx. Ideally, [Origraph](https://origraph.github.io) should be able to handle this, but:
1. There are non-graph wrangling operations involved, and
2. The OTF2 traces are way too big to fit in memory (and need special parsing)
